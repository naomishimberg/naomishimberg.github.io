I am a Research Assistant at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, where I work on climate, clean energy, and industrial policy. Last year, I graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in Ethics, Politics, & Economics and certificate in Energy Studies. My research interests are environmental and energy economics, labor economics, and applied microeconomics. 

At CEA, I primarily work with [Kyle Meng](https://www.kylemeng.com/) on a variety of topics. At Yale, I worked with [John Eric Humphries](https://johnerichumphries.com/), [Winnie Van Dijk](https://sites.google.com/site/winnielillianvandijk/), [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/), and [Gabriel Ulyssea](https://sites.google.com/view/gabriel-ulyssea) on topics relating to small businesses, the market for childcare services, rental markets, and union policy spillovers. My senior thesis addresssed intragenerational inequity in the social cost of carbon, and was advised by [Kenneth Gillingham](https://resources.environment.yale.edu/gillingham/) and [William Nordhaus](https://williamnordhaus.com/).

I am second-year economics Ph.D. student at MIT. My research addresses issues in environmental and energy economics, focusing on the structural changes to the U.S. economy necessary for the transition to clean energy. Previously, I worked at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, where I covered the climate and industrial strategy portfolios. I received my B.A. in Ethics, Politics, and Economics from Yale in 2023.

I am a senior at Yale University studying Ethics, Politics, & Economics and Energy Studies. My primary research interests are environmental and energy economics, labor economics, and applied microeconomics. Last year, I was selected as one of 55 Udall Scholars nationally for leadership, public service, and commitment to the environment.

At Yale, I've worked with [John Eric Humphries](https://johnerichumphries.com/), [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/), and [Gabriel Ulyssea](https://sites.google.com/view/gabriel-ulyssea) on topics relating to small businesses and the market for childcare services. My senior thesis addressses intragenerational inequity in the social cost of carbon, and is advised by [Ken Gillingham](https://resources.environment.yale.edu/gillingham/). Previously, I served as a climate and energy markets intern at the White House Council of Economic Advisors.

I am a Research Assistant at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, where I cover the climate and industrial strategy portfolios. Last year, I graduated *magna cum laude* from Yale with a B.A. in Ethics, Politics, and Economics and a certificate in Energy Studies. My [research](https://naomishimberg.github.io/research/) addresses issues in environmental, energy, and labor economics, focusing on the structural changes to the U.S. economy necessary for the transition to clean energy. If you'd like to contact me, my email is naomi.shimberg@yale.edu. You can find a copy of my CV [here](https://naomishimberg.github.io/files/ShimbergCV.pdf).

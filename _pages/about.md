I am first-year economics Ph.D. student at MIT. My [research](https://naomishimberg.github.io/research/) addresses issues in environmental, energy, and labor economics, focusing on the structural changes to the U.S. economy necessary for the transition to clean energy. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, where I covered the climate and industrial strategy portfolios. I received my B.A. in Ethics, Politics, and Economics from Yale in 2023.

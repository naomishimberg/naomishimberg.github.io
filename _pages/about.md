I am a Research Assistant at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, where I work on climate, clean energy, and industrial policy. Last year, I graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in Ethics, Politics, & Economics and a certificate in Energy Studies. My research interests are environmental and energy economics, labor economics, and applied microeconomics. 

If you'd like to contact me, my email is naomi.shimberg@yale.edu. You can find a copy of my CV [here](https://naomishimberg.github.io/files/ShimbergCV.pdf).

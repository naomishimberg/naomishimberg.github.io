**[Small firms and the pandemic: Evidence from Latin America]([url](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387821001358))** (with [Maria Elena Guerrero](https://mariaelenaguer.github.io/), [John Eric Humphries](https://johnerichumphries.com/index.html), [Christopher A. Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/), and [Gabriel Ulyssea](https://sites.google.com/view/gabriel-ulyssea)) \\
*Journal of Development Economics*, March 2022 \\
This paper studies the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses between March and November 2020 using new survey data on 35,000 small businesses in eight Latin American countries. We document that the pandemic had large negative impacts on employment and beliefs regarding the future, which in turn predict meaningful economic outcomes in the medium-term. Despite the unprecedented amount of aid, policies had limited impact for small and informal firms. These firms were less aware of programs, applied less, and received less assistance. This may have lasting consequences, as businesses that received aid reported better outcomes and expectations about the future.


## Works in Progress
**Intragenerational Inequality in the Social Cost of Carbon** (advised by [Kenneth Gillingham]([url](https://resources.environment.yale.edu/gillingham/)))\\
The social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) measures the monetized value of the damages to society caused by the additional emissions of one metric ton of CO2 emissions. Many refer to it as the most important number in climate policy. Following a 2017 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) highlighting that current SC-CO2 estimates no longer reflect the latest research, researchers have created the new open-source Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model. This paper incorporates equity-weighting, a long talked about "next step" in updating the SC-CO2, into the GIVE model, to reflect that the impacts of climate change asymmetrically affect people and regions.


**The Merit Order Effect of Wind and its Effects on Renewable Energy Policy: Evidence from New York** (with Seung Min Kim) \\
We establish the existence of the merit order effect caused by increased on-shore wind generation within the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). Using historical NYISO price and generation data from 2017-2021, we implement an instrumental variable approach to establish a causal relationship between wind generation and wholesale electricity prices. We find that wholesale energy prices fall by as much as 12% in load zones with wind generating assets. We use load zones that do not generate wind as a placebo test, finding no significant merit order effect in those regions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use an IV approach to establish the merit order effect, and the first to establish the merit order effect in New York.

**[An Analysis of Job Creation and Community Benefits from Green Investments]([url](https://climate-xchange.org/2021/05/24/new-climate-xchange-report-investing-in-a-better-massachusetts/))** (with [Jonah Kurman-Faber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonahkf/) and [Ruby Wincelle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubywincele/)) \\
This report analyzes the potential job creation and quality of life benefits from investing in clean transportation, sustainable development, clean energy, energy efficiency, and natural resource conservation in Massachusetts. These investments are found to create significantly more jobs per dollar than the state’s overall economy, as well as the state’s ten largest industries. Additionally, the investments return over two dollars in cost savings, time savings, and health benefits for every dollar invested. These findings can be re-weighted to project the potential jobs and community benefits from future spending packages in the Commonwealth.

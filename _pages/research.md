**[Small firms and the pandemic: Evidence from Latin America](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387821001358)** (with [Maria Elena Guerrero](https://mariaelenaguer.github.io/), [John Eric Humphries](https://johnerichumphries.com/index.html), [Christopher A. Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/), and [Gabriel Ulyssea](https://sites.google.com/view/gabriel-ulyssea)) \\

This paper studies the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses between March and November 2020 using new survey data on 35,000 small businesses in eight Latin American countries. We document that the pandemic had large negative impacts on employment and beliefs regarding the future, which in turn predict meaningful economic outcomes in the medium-term. Despite the unprecedented amount of aid, policies had limited impact for small and informal firms. These firms were less aware of programs, applied less, and received less assistance. This may have lasting consequences, as businesses that received aid reported better outcomes and expectations about the future.

**[Discounting and Mortality Valuation Can Cause Infinite Valuation of Human Lives](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4534871)** (with [R. Daniel Bressler](https://rdanielbressler.com/) and [Kenneth Gillingham](https://resources.environment.yale.edu/gillingham/)) \\

The use of a modular framework to calculate the social cost of greenhouse gases improves our understanding of uncertainty and enhances transparency. However, researchers must ensure that assumptions are compatible across modules. In this study, we show that following standard practice in Ramsey discounting and mortality valuation leads to deeply biased results. Indeed, under plausible assumptions about mortality damages from the recent literature, models will place infinite value on a single future life. This falsely suggests that climate change causes infinite damages, leaving it unanalyzable by benefit-cost analysis. We uncover straightforward solutions that ensure compatible monetization choices and lead to a stronger intellectual basis for the social cost of greenhouse gases.

**The Equity Weighted Social Cost of Carbon: Higher Estimates are Driven by Disproportionate Health Impacts on the Poor** (with [R. Daniel Bressler](https://rdanielbressler.com/), [Lisa Rennels](https://www.lisarennels.com/), [Frank Errickson](https://frankerrickson.github.io/), and [David Anthoff](https://www.david-anthoff.com/)) \\
Climate change is expected to cause a significant increase in heat-related deaths, although this will be attenuated by both a decrease in cold-related deaths and the benefits of future income growth in reducing vulnerability to heat. In this study, we combine a recent state-of-the-art climate-economy model (GIVE) with a mortality damage function that projects heat and cold-related mortality at the country-level and explicitly accounts for income-based adaptation to heat. Future income growth plays a significant role in reducing temperature-related mortality: climate change causes 85 million premature deaths from 2023-2100 when accounting for the benefits of future income growth and 181 million premature deaths without accounting for the benefits of future income growth. These impacts are highly unequal. When accounting for adaptation, we project a significant increase in premature deaths in the hottest and poorest locations and a slight decrease in premature deaths in some cold and rich locations. The large mortality damages experienced by the poor causes a significant increase in the equity weighted social cost of carbon (SCC), which accounts for diminishing marginal utility across space by weighting a dollar of damage to the poor more than a dollar of damage to the rich. Equity weighting increases the SCC by a factor of 2.4 when normalizing to global average income and by a factor of 14.8 when normalizing to U.S. income. Finally, we find that equity is more important than discounting in driving SCC results.

**[Labor Market Outcomes of the Clean Energy Transition](https://naomishimberg.github.io/files/Labor_Energy_Transition.pdf)** \\
This paper proposes a dynamic discrete choice framework to analyze the reallocation of workers from the fossil fuel "dirty" sector to the renewable energy "clean" sector. In the baseline model I focus on workers' decision-making processes and take the energy sector transition as an exogenous force. Workers' transition from the dirty to the clean sector lags the energy sector transition but occurs much more rapidly once it begins. High-skill workers are first to transition due to higher earnings potential in the clean sector while low-skill workers wait until the likelihood of losing their jobs in the dirty sector is too high to ignore. I then propose next steps for including human capital accumulation and erosion as well as multidimensional skill. I estimate the baseline model using the U.S. Energy and Employment Report, a detailed survey of 30,000 energy sector employers. Finally, I characterize the relationship between worker transition and energy sector transition for a variety of policy scenarios, including one that meets the current US goal of 100% clean power by 2035.

## Undergraduate Senior Essay
**[Intragenerational Equity in the Social Cost of Carbon]((https://naomishimberg.github.io/files/shimberg_thesis_final.pdf))** (advisor: [Kenneth Gillingham](https://resources.environment.yale.edu/gillingham/); second reader: [William Nordhaus](https://williamnordhaus.com/) \\

The social cost of carbon (SCC) reflects a partial estimate of the monetary damages caused by an incremental metric ton of CO2 emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a long-awaited update to the SCC, increasing its preferred value from $51 per tCO2 to $190 per tCO2. This is the first time the mortality impacts of climate change have been included in the SCC, reviving contentious debates about whether to monetize mortality risk with a value of a statistical life (VSL) that varies with income or remains constant across the population. The EPA diverges from past practice and uses an income-elastic VSL in its updated SCC, therefore assigning greater value to statistical lives in high-income countries than low-income countries. This senior essay proposes two alternative approaches, both of which assign equal value to all statistical lives: (1) using a global average VSL as an extension of past practice and (2) equity weighting—assigning greater weight to dollars in lower-income individuals’ hands. I ultimately defend the use of a global average VSL on ethical, economic, and practical grounds. I then implement each approach in the new open-source Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model, one of three models used by the EPA in its updated estimate. My preferred mean SCC is $380 per tCO2 ($10-$998 per tCO2: 5%-95% range, 2020 U.S. dollars), double the EPA’s proposed value. If used in benefit-cost analysis, this SCC would substantially increase the estimated benefits of climate change mitigation by reflecting that the harms of climate change are not borne equally across society.

## Non-Peer Reviewed Publications
**[An Analysis of Job Creation and Community Benefits from Green Investments](https://climate-xchange.org/2021/05/24/new-climate-xchange-report-investing-in-a-better-massachusetts/)** (with [Jonah Kurman-Faber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonahkf/) and [Ruby Wincelle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubywincele/)) \\
This report analyzes the potential job creation and quality of life benefits from investing in clean transportation, sustainable development, clean energy, energy efficiency, and natural resource conservation in Massachusetts. These investments are found to create significantly more jobs per dollar than the state’s overall economy, as well as the state’s ten largest industries. Additionally, the investments return over two dollars in cost savings, time savings, and health benefits for every dollar invested. These findings can be re-weighted to project the potential jobs and community benefits from future spending packages in the Commonwealth.

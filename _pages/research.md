**[Small firms and the pandemic: Evidence from Latin America](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387821001358)** (with [Maria Elena Guerrero](https://mariaelenaguer.github.io/), [John Eric Humphries](https://johnerichumphries.com/index.html), [Christopher A. Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/), and [Gabriel Ulyssea](https://sites.google.com/view/gabriel-ulyssea)) \\
*Journal of Development Economics*, March 2022 \\
This paper studies the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses between March and November 2020 using new survey data on 35,000 small businesses in eight Latin American countries. We document that the pandemic had large negative impacts on employment and beliefs regarding the future, which in turn predict meaningful economic outcomes in the medium-term. Despite the unprecedented amount of aid, policies had limited impact for small and informal firms. These firms were less aware of programs, applied less, and received less assistance. This may have lasting consequences, as businesses that received aid reported better outcomes and expectations about the future.

## Working Papers
**[Discounting and Mortality Valuation Can Cause Infinite Valuation of Human Lives](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4534871)** (with [R. Daniel Bressler](https://rdanielbressler.com/) and [Kenneth Gillingham](https://resources.environment.yale.edu/gillingham/)) \\
August 2023 \\
Per the National Academy of Sciences’ 2017 recommendations, the social cost of carbon (SCC) is now calculated with a modular framework in which researchers can easily substitute different models for estimating climate damages. The modular approach is an improvement from previous practice, but great care must be taken to ensure that assumptions made in each of the modules are mutually compatible. Here, we show that following the standard practice in mortality valuation and Ramsey discounting, combined with using some of the latest temperature-related mortality damage functions, will cause the model to place infinite value on a single future life. This falsely suggests that climate change causes infinite damage and that climate change is unanalyzable by benefit-cost analysis, in line with the Dismal Theorem. However, this finding, in this case, is merely due to internally incompatible monetization choices. We suspect that multiple models have this issue, but we discuss it here in the context of the GIVE model because it is open-source and easily accessible. Fortunately, this issue is straightforward to address and we discuss several options.

## Works in Progress
**The Equity Weighted Social Cost of Carbon: Higher Estimates are Driven by Disproportionate Health Impacts on the Poor** (with [R. Daniel Bressler](https://rdanielbressler.com/), [Lisa Rennels](https://www.lisarennels.com/), [Frank Errickson](https://frankerrickson.github.io/), and [David Anthoff](https://www.david-anthoff.com/)) \\
Climate change is expected to cause a significant increase in heat-related deaths, although this will be attenuated by both a decrease in cold-related deaths and the benefits of future income growth in reducing vulnerability to heat. In this study, we combine a recent state-of-the-art climate-economy model (GIVE) with a mortality damage function that projects heat and cold-related mortality at the country-level and explicitly accounts for income-based adaptation to heat. Future income growth plays a significant role in reducing temperature-related mortality: climate change causes 85 million premature deaths from 2023-2100 when accounting for the benefits of future income growth and 181 million premature deaths without accounting for the benefits of future income growth. These impacts are highly unequal. When accounting for adaptation, we project a significant increase in premature deaths in the hottest and poorest locations and a slight decrease in premature deaths in some cold and rich locations. The large mortality damages experienced by the poor causes a significant increase in the equity weighted social cost of carbon (SC-CO$_2$), which accounts for diminishing marginal utility across space by weighting a dollar of damage to the poor more than a dollar of damage to the rich. Equity weighting increases the SC-CO$_2$ by a factor of 2.4 when normalizing to global average income (from $218 per tCO$_2$ to $527 per tCO$_2$) and by a factor of 14.8 when normalizing to U.S. income ($3,224 per tCO$_2$). Finally, we find that equity is more important than discounting in driving SC-CO$_2$ results.

**[Labor Market Outcomes of the Clean Energy Transition](https://github.com/naomishimberg/files/Labor_Energy_Transition.pdf)** \\
This paper proposes a dynamic discrete choice framework to analyze the reallocation of workers from the fossil fuel "dirty" sector to the renewable energy "clean" sector. In the baseline model I focus on workers' decision-making processes and take the energy sector transition as an exogenous force. Workers' transition from the dirty to the clean sector lags the energy sector transition but occurs much more rapidly once it begins. High-skill workers are first to transition due to higher earnings potential in the clean sector while low-skill workers wait until the likelihood of losing their jobs in the dirty sector is too high to ignore. I then propose next steps for including human capital accumulation and erosion as well as multidimensional skill. I estimate the baseline model using the U.S. Energy and Employment Report, a detailed survey of 30,000 energy sector employers. Finally, I characterize the relationship between worker transition and energy sector transition for a variety of policy scenarios, including one that meets the current US goal of 100\% clean power by 2035.

**The Merit Order Effect of Wind and its Effects on Renewable Energy Policy: Evidence from New York** (with Seung Min Kim) \\
We establish the existence of the merit order effect caused by increased on-shore wind generation within the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). Using historical NYISO price and generation data from 2017-2021, we implement an instrumental variable approach to establish a causal relationship between wind generation and wholesale electricity prices. We find that wholesale energy prices fall by as much as 12% in load zones with wind generating assets. We use load zones that do not generate wind as a placebo test, finding no significant merit order effect in those regions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use an IV approach to establish the merit order effect, and the first to establish the merit order effect in New York. 

## Non-Peer Reviewed Publications
**[An Analysis of Job Creation and Community Benefits from Green Investments](https://climate-xchange.org/2021/05/24/new-climate-xchange-report-investing-in-a-better-massachusetts/)** (with [Jonah Kurman-Faber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonahkf/) and [Ruby Wincelle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubywincele/)) \\
This report analyzes the potential job creation and quality of life benefits from investing in clean transportation, sustainable development, clean energy, energy efficiency, and natural resource conservation in Massachusetts. These investments are found to create significantly more jobs per dollar than the state’s overall economy, as well as the state’s ten largest industries. Additionally, the investments return over two dollars in cost savings, time savings, and health benefits for every dollar invested. These findings can be re-weighted to project the potential jobs and community benefits from future spending packages in the Commonwealth.
